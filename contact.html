                I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Currently in my fifth year, I am studying environmental science with minors in photography and computer science. I started exploring photography as a middle schooler while on school field trips when I was in Iran. Since then, I have found my passion in communicating through photos. In Madison, I explored photography further in class, and explored concepts of immigration, identity, and psyche. <br><br>
                I continues to use photography to explore myself and disect my thoughts. Furthermore, I hope to use this medium professionally as a mean to communicate environmental issues to others. In conjunction to photography, I enjoy maps and graphic design as a way of storytelling. You can explore my work on this website. <br><br>
